  This script is meant to find the optimal laser settings for activation of
  whatever (it was originally written for PAGFP and mEos2).  The basic idea is
  to use something such as H2B in order to have a large area that can be
  activated and compare the intensity on each pixel after activation with the
  control intensity (something expressed in tandem for PAGFP or the green
  intensity for mEos2).  A single cell expressing H2B-mEos2 could then be used
  to try 2 or 3 different laser settings.
  
  It accepts the directory with the images as last argument.
  
  The laser settings should be encoded on the filename since it's not always
  possible to read it from the file metadata.  Other scripts, to rename the
  files, can be written for those purposes. The expected filename format is:
  
  cell=XX, bleach=x, pixel-dwell=xx.xx, laser-power=xxx, laser-iterations=xx
  
  Spaces between parameter names and comma are optional.

## octave loads all images as a big stack, whether they are different channels
## or times. There should be only 4 necessary images (pre and after activation
## on the control and the activation channel). In such case, the laser activation
## would happen between frame 2 and 3. To avoid mobility of the molecules, the
## actual activation channel would be the first image after activation (frame 3)
## so it's pair would be frame
