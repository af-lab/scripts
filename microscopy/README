List of scripts and their application:

  * draw.ijm      - make useful drawings on the image, non-destructive, with
                    overlays.

  * Library.txt   - to place in ImageJ macro/ directory. It implements different
                    new functions for other macros to use (other ImageJ macros
                    from this list are likely to need this file). These new
                    functions allow for cleaner code for array manipulation,
                    transversing a directory tree, etc...
