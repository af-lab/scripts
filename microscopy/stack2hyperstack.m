## @deftypefn {Function File} {} stack2hyperstack (@var{img}, @var{size}, @var{in}, @var{out})
## Rearrange multi dimensional image.
##
## When an multi-dimensional image is read with @code{imread}, it's returned as
## a MxNx1xP matrix. Different channels, positions and time are discarded.
## Depending on the format used, they might as well be all mixed.
##
## The variable @var{size} must be a vector with the order corresponding to @var{in}.
## The order @var{out} might rearrange that order.
##
## The variables @var{in} and @var{out} must be a string composed of the letters
## c (channel), z (Z-slice), t (time point), and p (position).
##
## @example
## @group
## ## reads and image that is MxNx10 where the last dimension alternates between
## ## the different channels, before changing the z-slice and returns a MxNx2x5
## ## matrix (2 channels and 5 z-slices)
## stack2hyperstack (img, [2 5], "cz", "cz")
## @end group
##
## @group
## ## reads and image that is MxNx100 where the last dimension alternates between
## ## the different channels, then Z-slice and finnaly time. It returns a MxNx2x10x5
## ## matrix
## stack2hyperstack (img, [2 5 10], "czt", "ctz")
## @end group
##
## @end deftypefn

function img = stack2hyperstack (img, vec_size, in = "cztp", out = in)
  ## should we make this a struct instead a ND matrix?
