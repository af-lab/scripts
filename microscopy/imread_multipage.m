## @deftypefn {Function File} {} imread_multipage (@var{filename})
## Read multipage TIFF image.
##
## The call to this function is the same as @code{imread}, the only difference
## is that by default loads all the pages in case of a multipage TIFF.
##
## This is the same as @code{imread (filename, 1:numel (imfinfo (filename)))}
##
## @end deftypefn

function [img, map, alpha] = imread_multipage (filename)
  ## FIXME the code only deals with tif files... should port the OMERO toolbox
  ## for Octave and drop this limitation
  [img, map, alpha] = imread (filename, 1:numel (imfinfo (filename)));
endfunction
