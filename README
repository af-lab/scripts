This repository has a collection of different scripts written and used in our
lab. They vary widely by application and the organization of the repository is
a bit loose, so make sure you check all the subdirectories.

Note that each script may be written on its own language and be dependent on
external libraries and/or applications such as BioPerl.

  * bioinformatics/ - bioinformatics scripts such as sequence analysis

  * chemistry/      - chemical analysis such as pH, concentrations

  * cloning/        - help in cloning such as designing of genes and primers
