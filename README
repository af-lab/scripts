This repository has a collection of different scripts written and used in our
lab. They vary widely by application and the organization of the repository is
a bit loose, so make sure you check all the subdirectories.

If this repository looks a bit empty, or if the scripts look too simple,
that's a good thing. We aim to implement the things we need in other bigger
projects, thus being useful for a larger group of people. It also means that
it's much easier for others to find and install our work, since the other
projects will already have distribution methods (and are packaged by many
Linux distributions).

Note that each script may be written on its own language and be dependent on
external libraries and/or applications such as BioPerl.

  * bioinformatics/ - bioinformatics scripts such as sequence analysis

  * chemistry/      - chemical analysis such as pH, concentrations

  * cloning/        - help in cloning such as designing of genes and primers

  * microscopy/     - analysis of microscopy images

  * miscellaneous/  - things that don't fit anywhere else

  * sysadmin/       - to help on keeping the system going and users happy
