## takes a single argument which should be a csv file with 2 columns (x on the
## first and y on the second)

## exponential decay function is:
##
## y = y0 * exp(-λ*t)
##
## where:
##   * y0 is value of y at t=0
##   * λ is decay constant
##   * τ (mean lifetime) is τ = 1/λ
##
## We could try to fit this with leasqr (nlinfit in MatLab) but that would be
## stupid when we can just linearize it and do linear regression:
##
##          y = y0 * exp(-λ*t)           <=>
## <=> log(y) = log(y0 * exp(-λ*t))      <=>
## <=> log(y) = log(y0) + log(exp(-λ*t)) <=>
## <=> log(y) = log(y0) + (-λ*t)         <=>
## <=> log(y) = log(y0) - λ*t
