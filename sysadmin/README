List of scripts and their application:

  * htpasswd.html     - HTML page so users can request a new account on the
                        system. Used to create new subversion accounts but can
                        probably be used for other things. Depends on the
                        htpasswd_new.cgi script.

  * htpasswd_new.cgi  - Perl script to store a list of requested new users. If
                        accepted, the sysadmin only needs to move the entry to
                        the actual passwd file and never gets to see the pass.
