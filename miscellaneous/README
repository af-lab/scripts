List of scripts and their application:

  * labels.js         - javascript for the LAT HTML pages. It implements the
                        `calculator' that helps on making similar labels.

                        Bradley.

  * LAT59.html        - HTML page to help with writing labels for the LAT59 model
                        from Bradley. Depends on LAT59_creator.pl and labels.js.

  * LAT7.html         - HTML page to help with writing labels for the LAT7 model
                        from Bradley. Depends on LAT7_creator.pl and labels.js.

                        model. Obviously, depends on LAT_processor.pm
