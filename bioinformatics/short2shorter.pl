## Convert protein sequence using the 3 letter amino acid code, into
## IUPAC code. Reads sequence from STDIN.
##
## Examples:
##
##  bioinformatics/short2shorter.pl <<< "MetAlaGluTer"
##  bioinformatics/short2shorter.pl <<< echo file_with_sequence_in_3_letter
##
## will print:
##
##  MAE*

use 5.010;
use strict;
use warnings;
use Bio::PrimarySeq;
use Bio::SeqUtils;

## we will print the string only, but we a protein Bio::Seq to use seq3in
my $seq = Bio::PrimarySeq->new(
  -alphabet => "protein",
);

say Bio::SeqUtils->seq3in($seq, $_)->seq() while (<STDIN>);
