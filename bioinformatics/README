List of scripts and their application:

  * find_seq_by_freq  - search amino acid sequences for short sequences specially
                        rich in something. For example, search protein sequences
                        for 10aa spaces with >7 [GS] (for hypothetical hinges)

  * pretty_fasta      - saves sequence in a fasta format with controlled whitespace
                        for ease of read and count. This has later been incorporated
                        into bioperl as Bio::SeqIO::fasta options.
