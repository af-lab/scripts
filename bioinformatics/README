List of scripts and their application:

  * blast_histones    - blast sequence of all 4 histones against a sequence
                        (a chromosome), and report the order and locations where
                        they appear. Meant to find histone genes, even if not
                        annotated, and show their organization on a cluster.

  * find_seq_by_freq  - search amino acid sequences for short sequences specially
                        rich in something. For example, search protein sequences
                        for 10aa spaces with >7 [GS] (for hypothetical hinges)

  * pretty_fasta      - saves sequence in a fasta format with controlled whitespace
                        for ease of read and count. This has later been incorporated
                        into bioperl as Bio::SeqIO::fasta options.

  * short2shorter     - convert protein sequence in the 3 letter amino code,
                        into the 1 letter, IUPAC code.
